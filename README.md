# About

**[localthreat](https://next.localthreat.xyz/)** is an online tool to help EVE players with threat assessment.

# Development

The code and documentation are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat). The design lives on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BPH2xeVvbBDAnWpjMI58GpnW/localthreat.next). Bug tracking, feature request, and any other feedback must be made on the [repository's issues page](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat/issues/new).

## Docker setup (recommended)

You'll need to be resolving any subdomain of localhost to localhost. If you're using Chrome it does that automatically. Otherwise you'll need to edit your `hosts` file or something like [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html).

With Docker running and docker-compose installed, run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

This will boot everything you need in one go. You can resume your work later with the same command.

If it's your first run though, you'll need to seed the database; with the containers running:

```shell
$ docker-compose exec -T db psql -h localhost -U postgres postgres < api/schema.sql
```

You can access the app at http://client-localthreat.localhost and the API at http://api-localthreat.localhost.

## Manual setup

If you don't have Docker or don't want to deal with proxies you can build and run everything locally.

### API

It's a simple web server written in Go that talks JSON.

You'll need Go 1.15+ installed. Hop into the `api/` sub-directory and run:

```shell
$ go get
```

To download all the dependencies and then:

```shell
$ make test
$ make
```

To test and build the binary.

You'll also need PostgreSQL 12+ running. Load `api/schema.sql` file into your database and run:

```shell
$ DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres ./localthreat -addr ":5000"
```

This will start the API server. You might want to adjust the `DATABASE_URL` value accordingly.

### Client

It's a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) written in TypeScript.

You'll need Node 14+ and npm installed. Hop into the `client` sub-directory and run:

```shell
$ npm install
```

To download all the dependencies and then:

```shell
$ REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 npm run-script start
```

To start the development server.
